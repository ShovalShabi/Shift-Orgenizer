# Shift-Organizer
Hello and welcome to the Shift Organizer SwimmingClub Application!
This application is a .NET Core UI desktop application for shift scheduling of a country club and is designated for club administration.
The system schedules lessons by the availabilities of each instructor and their abilities for a perfect match to a student who wants to take swimming lessons, the management can assign students to lessons and instructors as well.

Before use it's very important to have several things:
1."Universal Windows Platform development" tool installed on your Visual Studio Code.
2.MySql Localhost server and an IDE to create the database, you'll need to run the script that creates the database.

*To enter the database please alter the code to your server, username, and password in Class DatabaseConnector.

Several assumptions:
-Any student that wants to learn a bunch of specialties can study them in every lesson that contains them all!
-If a public lesson is overlapping another public lesson and they are quite similar the student will enter the *existing lesson*

Thank you for your attention, and I hope you'll enjoy experiencing my application!
